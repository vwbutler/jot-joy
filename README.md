# Project: Jot Joy

## Description
  
  Here is the Note Taker Express.js application, also known as Jot Joy. This application allows you to write and save notes, helping you organize your thoughts and keep track of tasks you need to complete. The back end of this application is built with Express.js and uses a JSON file to store and retrieve note data. Joy Joy brings together a pre-built front end with a newly created back end connected and deployed to Heroku.

As an added bonus, users may delete their notes.
